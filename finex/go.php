        <h4><u>About &#39;Go Premium or Go Normal&#39;</u></h4>
        <p>How to win? Buy as many goods you can, but DON’T GET BANKRUPT!!!</p>
        <p>1. At least 2 groups (max 4 groups) are needed to play this game.</p>
        <p>2. Players choose 1 out of 2 types of credit card (Premium Card or Normal Card).</p>
        <p>3.1 Premium Card: $1000 annual fee to be paid every round but gets 10% discount per purchase.</p>
        <p>3.2 Normal Card: $500 annual fee to be paid every round but doesn’t get any discount on purchases.</p>
        <p>4. Players roll the dice and move their piece to its respective box according to the number of dots obtained (same in monopoly), players can proceed as many rounds as they can within 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. There will be a total of 12 purchase box, 10 bonus boxes and 8 mini game boxes.</p>
        <p>6. Each box on the board represents different action:</p>
            <p>● Mini game box - Players play game to earn money.</p>
            <p>● Bonus box - Players either earn or loss a certain amount of money straightaway.</p>
            <p>● Purchase box - Players purchase goods using credit card.</p>
            <p>7. Players are required to buy goods to earn points.</p>
            <p>8. Players are required to pay the money they owe the bank (credit card) as well as the annual fees charged by the bank every round, otherwise they will be bankrupt.</p>
            <p>9. Upon bankruptcy, the group will stop proceeding. Each player chooses to
play a minigame as penalty, and the game only continues after every
player in the group has done their respective minigame. Upon
completion, the debt will return to zero. However, the final point of this
station will be deducted by 3000. So, THINK BEFORE SPENDING!!!</p>
<p>10.Final point: Product price + (Cash on hand/2)- Bankruptcy Penalty</p>
<p>11.Point of this station will be converted to FINEX point through a system.</p>
