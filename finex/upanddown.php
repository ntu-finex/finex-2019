        <h4><u>About &#39;Up and Down&#39;</u></h4>
        <p>1)	Teams start off with 100,000 dollars, where they will decide how much of it do they want to invest into bonds. They would have no more chances to buy bonds after this.</p>
        <p>2)	The remaining money is used to buy stocks. Players can buy/sell stocks at any point in time of the game.</p>
        <p>3)	Teams will then be given a magazine with 20 bullets, where they would use their skills to decide the outcome of the stocks</p>
        <p>4)	Teams have to shoot 1 target from the top row, labelled in colors to determine which stock they represent.</p>
        <p>5)	Next, they have to shoot 1 target from the bottom row, where the value of the stocks will increase/decrease depending on which target they hit.</p>
        <p>6)	Everytime there is a change in the value of a stock, it is considered as 1 round, which contributes to the maturity of the bonds</p>
        <p>7)	At the end of the 20 bullets, the bonds that have matured would have payouts, the stocks would be sold at their current price. The scores would then be tabulated.</p>
