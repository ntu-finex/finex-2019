        <p>Imagine you are the government of Singapore. Your goal is to maximise Singapore’s GDP. You may increase the GDP by increasing any of the components in GDP (C , I, G and NX) However, assume that only G and NX are within your control. Based on the amount of money (“resources / reserves”) you have, you are to increase the GDP for Singapore to accumulate the most points.</p>
