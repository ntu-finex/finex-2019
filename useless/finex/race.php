        <h4><u>About &#39;Race through life&#39;</u></h4>
        <p>1)	Participants will first answer 3 questions regarding investments at the start. Questions are in True/False and MCQ formats. Number of correct answers will enable participants to be eligible for careers in a certain tier.</p>
        <p>3 Correct Answers: Tier 1</p>
        <p>2 Correct Answers: Tier 2</p>
        <p>0 or 1 Correct Answers: Tier 3</p>
        <p>-Career Choice: Doctor, Annual Salary $200,000(Tier 1) </p>
        <p>Engineer, Annual Salary $150,000(Tier 2)</p>
        <p>Teacher, Annual Salary $120, 000(Tier 3)</p>
        <p>2)	Participants now have a career and will be given an occupational tool. They will then go onto the first task having earned 10 years’ salary to be credited into their bank passbook. Participants will then line up along a 50m track. They will then kick a ball to each other until the last participant receives the ball. If the ball deviates from the track, an unsuccessful attempt is recorded. Participants must attempt this task 3 times. </p>
        <p>3 Successful Attempt:  Can choose any house they like</p>
        <p>2 Successful Attempt: Cannot choose Bungalow</p>
        <p>No or 1 Successful Attempt: Only eligible for HDB</p>
        <p>Houses: Bungalow, $3,000,000. Resale Value $4,000,000</p>
        <p>Condo, $1,500,000. Resale Value $2,000,000</p>
        <p>HDB, $1,000,000. Resale Value $1,500,000 </p>
        <p>Home Loans are at an interest rate of 3.5% simple interest to be repaid in 30 years. </p>
        <p>Having chosen their house, participants will calculate the interest they need to repay for their home loan. All their available money must be used to foot a down payment. The shortfall is borrowed from the bank and is repayable with interest. The interest and principal they must pay will be deducted from their account at the end of the game. </p>
        <p>3) Participants will then go onto the second task, having earned another 10 years of salary. They will have to transport 3 ping pong balls one at a time using their occupational tools along a 20m track without dropping it to record a successful attempt. </p>
        <p>3 balls: 1 Child</p>
        <p>2 balls: 2 children</p>
        <p>0 or 1 ball: 3 children </p>
        <p>Now that the participants have children, they will have to set aside $1,000,000 for each child’s education in 20 years’ time. Participants must calculate how much money they must invest a year if they can earn 5% return on their investments every year. The total sum of money invested is to be deducted from their account at the end of the game. (Round off Ans to nearest thousand)</p>
        <p>4) Another 10 years have passed, and participants will earn yet another 10 years of salary. 
Participants will then attempt to do as many push-ups as possible in half a minute. Only one participant from each team need to take part. If they do above 25 push-ups, their annual salary increases by $50,000. If they do between 20-24 push-ups, their annual salary increases by $30,000. Anything below 20 push-ups will give them an annual salary increase of $10,000. This increase is only effective after completing this stage. 
</p>
        <p>5) Participants now earn another 10 years’ worth of salary, and they will attempt one final question to win a lottery of $1,000,000.
Participants will then repay their home loan with interest and sell their house. The total sum of money invested in their child’s education will also be deducted. They will tabulate their ending amount of retirement money with the gamemaster using the bank passbook.
